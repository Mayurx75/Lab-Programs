## Introduction
The primary goal of this notebook is to demonstrate linear regression techniques in Python using real-world data. The notebook covers data import, exploratory data analysis, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Getting Started
To run this notebook, you need Python 3.x and the following packages installed. You can set up the environment by running the `requirements.txt` file, which contains all dependencies.

## Notebook Overview

### 1. Basic Imports
This section initializes essential libraries for data analysis and machine learning, such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.

### 2. Linear Regression Analysis
This section focuses on building a linear regression model using scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` class. It includes data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation
In this section, the notebook trains the model on a dataset and evaluates its performance using common metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage
To run the notebook, execute the cells sequentially after ensuring all dependencies are installed.
